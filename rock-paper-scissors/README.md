# Rock Paper Scissors

Rock Paper Scissors is a classic hand game where the player competes against the computer.  
The player chooses one of three options: **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors**. The rules are simple:
- Rock crushes Scissors
- Scissors cuts Paper
- Paper covers Rock

If both the player and the computer choose the same item, the game results in a **tie**.  
This project was built with Angular and styled using Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive design.
